              <p>As the designer, I was responsible for designing the UI, UX, and rendering layouts. I created
                frameworks and prototypes
                to share the vision, design principles, and section strategy. This helped to conceptualize ideas, gain
                alignment, and

                <dl>I have learned several things about developing a financial management platform.
                </dl>
                <li class="article__list">A user-centered approach is essential for creating a platform that effectively
                  meets the needs of the users. By
                  conducting user research and gathering feedback, we can ensure that the final solution addresses the
                  users' pain
                  points
                  and helps them achieve their goals.</li>
                <li class="article__list">A holistic view of financial assets and personalized investment
                  recommendations
                  are important features that can help
                  users make more informed investment decisions and manage their finances more effectively.</li>
                <li class="article__list">Design Thinking process is a valuable approach for solving complex problem,
                  like
                  this one, as it allows for
                  flexibility,
                  iteration and user-centered approach.</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="article__sub-title">üåü Practice Makes Perfect!</div>
              <p>I learned a lot while designing this landing page, not only developing my problem solving skills and
                user
                interface
                convenience, but I also increasingly understood that by using the financial management platform
                regularly,
                users will
                become more proficient and confident in managing their finances. The more they use the platform, the
                more
                they will
                understand its features and capabilities, and the more effectively they will be able to manage their
                financial assets.
                Additionally, as the platform is refined and improved over time based on user feedback, users will have
                access to an
                increasingly user-friendly and effective tool for managing their finances.</p>
              <p>It's also important to note that, by integrating with other financial apps and services, the platform
                will provide a
                more complete picture of the user's financial situation, which can help users better understand their
                financial
                situation and make more informed decisions.</p>
